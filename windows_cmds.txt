// HOW TO CREATE THE WINDOWS 32BIT VERSION OF LENAContingenciesV3
// ==============================================================

// be aware that some paths included in this doc may be different per 
// your machine. i.e. python install and script locations
// As the Dr. Dong says, "Be Careful" | "Pay Attention"

// first tho, just install python on the C: drive the old school way. 
// goto python.com or whatever and download the windows msi installer
// or whatever. 

// once you get pyhon installed, make sure you have the 32-bit versions of 
// python 2 and python 3 installed. 
// use pip to install pyinstaller, 

// try to avoid using a linux shell on win for this, 
// i.e. cygwin or git-bash.
// trusht meh, it's easier just doing it native win way.

// run these cmds in CMD or powershell or whatever the fluff 
// windows cmd propmt is called nowadays
// back in the day we called it DOS yo.

// directory structure may vary, but args and flags are saem
// run these from the src/ directory of the project. 

// build a specfile for pyinstaller!
// these wondrous command~line flags create a specfile that will build 
// a near~flawless executable with no cmd promt window and a custom icon, 
// as well as a single file exe for portability. 
"C:\python27\Scripts\pyi-makespec" --onefile --windowed --noconsole control.py -i=../icon/lenacon3_icon.ico --name=LENAContingenciesV3 --hidden-import=xlsxwriter

// this creates the necessary .spec file
// that pyinstaller needs to create your beautiful win~32 executable
// try to avoid rolling  your own .spec file, it will end in tears
// for whatever reason, home~rolled .spec files get ignored or overwritten
// there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth

// now you're ready to experience the magic of pyinstaller!
// run this from the same dir as the .spec file and control.py
// or whatever the main python file of teh project is. 

"C:\python27\Scripts\pyinstaller" LENAContingenciesV3.spec --workpath=../build --distpath=../dist/ --onefile

// this will create a windows .exe in the project level dist folder, i.e. one up from source. 
// have fun and enjoy the bliss that is the windows 32~bit GUI environment.
