// build a specfile for pyinstaller!
// first tho, just install python on the C: drive the old school way. 
// goto python.com or whatever and download the windows msi installer
// or whatever. 

// once you get pyhon installed, 
// use pip to install pyinstaller, 

// try to avoid using a linux shell on win for this, 
// i.e. cygwin or git-bash.
// trusht meh, it's easier just doing it native win way.

// run these cmds in CMD or powershell or whatever the fluff 
// windows cmd propmt is called nowadays
// back in the day we called it DOS yo.

// directory structure may vary, but args and flags are saem
// run these from the src/ directory of the project. 

"C:\python27\Scripts\pyi-makespec" --onefile control.py -i=../icon/lenacon3_icon.ico --name=LENAContingenciesV3 --hidden-import=xlsxwriter

// this creates the necessary .spec file
// try to avoid rolling  your own .spec file, 
// for whatever reason, home~rolled .spec files get ignored

// now you're ready to experience the magic of pyinstaller!
// run this from the same dir as the .spec file and control.py
// or whatever the main python file of teh project is.
