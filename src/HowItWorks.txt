Program steps:
1. Specify input directory
2. Specify type of analysis
3. Configure analysis type selected
4. Specify pause length
5. Specify output directory

How does the sequencing work?

"for k,v in batch.items.iteritems():
    sa = SeqAnalysis(varMap, k, v)"
> line 98 - control.py
> This code block starts the sequence analysis. "sa" is an object of type SeqAnalysis. 
    In the initialization of this object the analysis is performed on every key, value 
    (k,v) pair in the batch. The batch is a list locations of all .its files found in 
    the directory specified by the user.

"for fpath in self.fpaths:
    self.Perform(fpath)"
> line 184 - SeqAnalysis.py
> This is the last two lines of the initialization function of the SeqAnalysis object.
    It kicks off the sequence analysis.

SEQUENCE ANALYSIS is done with a finite state machine!!!

    we'll have to make it work with the new program gui.
